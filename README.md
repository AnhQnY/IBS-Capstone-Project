# IBS-Capstone-Project

The research, written in relation to completion of the Master of Science, explores the possible application of text mining techniques in legal documents. The chosen theme was the penalty notices associated with data protection incidents that occurred after the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2016. The primary objectives of the research include identifying the common causes for data breaches and answering the question how these may influence the severity of the penalty given.

Employing text mining and natural language processing the project extracted data from publicly available documents and related metadata released by supervisory authorities collected by enforcement databases. The methods used includes named-entity recognition (NER) to identify and extract organizations and entities and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to generate topics from the documents gaining better understanding of the data protection authoritiesâ€™ decisions.

The workspace contains the following subfolders: 

- Interim outputs: As uploading and extracting a documents takes a significant time to speed up the process, on certain points the csv file can be used
- Engagement tracker info: Contains the metadata extracted from  https://www.enforcementtracker.com/

As the the PDF Files take too much time to upload and download, due its size, the file is hosted on the following Google Drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XDmVcB5R_5xRoZooqFG17AMr3MJ4RoYp/view?usp=drive_link
